# 🚀 ZenOps

> **A Context-Aware AI DevOps Assistant built with OpenClaw, Cognee, and Discord**

ZenOps is an AI-powered DevOps assistant that enables engineers to manage Linux servers using natural language through Discord.

Unlike traditional AI assistants that lose context between conversations, ZenOps combines short-term conversational memory with long-term semantic infrastructure memory, allowing it to remember both previous conversations and the state of managed servers.

# ✨ Features

- 🤖 Natural language infrastructure management
- 💬 Discord-native interface
- 🖥️ Multi-server management
- 🔗 Channel-to-server binding
- 🧠 Long-term infrastructure memory using Cognee
- 💭 Short-term conversational memory
- 🔍 Infrastructure discovery
- ⚡ OpenClaw-powered command execution
- 🔒 Secure communication over Tailscale
- 🚀 Distributed architecture supporting multiple VPSs

---

# 🎯 Why ZenOps?

Managing multiple Linux servers usually means:

- Remembering which server you're connected to
- Switching between SSH sessions
- Repeating context to AI assistants
- Manually rediscovering infrastructure
- Losing previous troubleshooting knowledge

ZenOps solves this by giving every server an AI agent with persistent memory.

Instead of remembering your infrastructure, **ZenOps remembers it for you.**

# 🧠 Memory Architecture

ZenOps intentionally separates memory into two layers.

## Short-Term Memory

Stored in PostgreSQL.

Responsible for:

* Recent conversation history
* Contextual follow-up questions
* Pronoun resolution
* Channel-specific sessions

Example:

```text
Install nginx.

Configure it for my React app.

Restart it.
```

The assistant understands what **"it"** refers to.

## Long-Term Memory

Powered by Cognee.

Stores semantic infrastructure knowledge including:

* Installed software
* Infrastructure discoveries
* Server metadata
* Previous observations
* Configuration history

Unlike chat history, this memory persists across future conversations.

---

# ⚡ Execution Pipeline

For every `/zen ask` request:

1. **ExecutionResolver** determines the target server (bound, global, or explicit).
2. **PromptBuilder** assembles the system prompt using:

   * Server metadata
   * Recent conversation
   * Cognee memories
3. **AgentService** sends the prompt to the appropriate OpenClaw instance.
4. The response is returned to Discord.
5. Conversation history is persisted.
6. Cognee updates long-term memory asynchronously in the background.

# 🏆 Cognee Hangover Hackathon

ZenOps was demonstrated using a distributed architecture consisting of:

* A dedicated FastAPI orchestration server
* Discord bot
* Multiple Linux VPSs
* Two independent OpenClaw instances
* Self-hosted Qwen3 8B
* Cognee semantic memory
* FastEmbed embeddings
* Private networking via Tailscale

When a new VPS is registered:

1. It runs an OpenClaw instance.
2. It joins the private Tailscale network.
3. It registers with the FastAPI backend.
4. Infrastructure discoveries are stored in Cognee.
5. Future conversations benefit from shared semantic infrastructure knowledge.

This enables every managed server to contribute to a unified infrastructure knowledge graph.

---

# 🔒 Security

ZenOps follows a private-network-first architecture.

* OpenClaw APIs are never publicly exposed.
* Communication occurs exclusively over Tailscale.
* Services bind only to Tailscale interfaces.
* MagicDNS replaces public IP addresses.
* Infrastructure execution is performed only through registered OpenClaw agents.

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

* Multi-server orchestration
* Kubernetes support
* Infrastructure graph visualization
* Role-based access control
* Approval workflows for destructive operations
* Autonomous maintenance workflows
* Web dashboard
